# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: January 04, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I added Redux (and the connection to the chrome devtools extension) to keep my selection state somewhere. This may seem overkill at first, I could just have used the internal state of the surrounding component. But I already know that I want to be able to display the last action in a separate section of the page. Transformed the components to be stateless and fixed linting issues while at it.

**Thoughts**: A bit boring to do but now, it will be pretty easy to connect the rendering with the state and dispatch actions on clicks.

### Day 1: January 03, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Decided for a project. I want to tackle again creating a website to showcase the functionality of a library me and a coworker created. Its name is [Yourchoice](https://github.com/actano/yourchoice). I checked out what I did so far and upgraded the dependencies. 

**Thoughts**: It's great to work on this again. I want to give Yourchoice some publicity which is much easier if there is a demo page.
