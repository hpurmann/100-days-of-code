# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 03, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Decided for a project. I want to tackle again creating a website to showcase the functionality of a library me and a coworker created. Its name is [Yourchoice](https://github.com/actano/yourchoice). I checked out what I did so far and upgraded the dependencies. 

**Thoughts**: It's great to work on this again. I want to give Yourchoice some publicity which is much easier if there is a demo page.
